                <p>I'm an enthusiastic and diligent individual born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. I'm
                    passionate about helping people by problem solving through software development.</p>

                <p>I'm currently working towards a Bachelors of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo
                    and expecting to graduate by the end of 2021. I major in Computational Mathematics and
                    plan to graduate with multiple minors across different fields (Computing Technology,
                    Combinatorics & Optimization, Geography & Environmental Management).</p>

                <p>In my free time, I find joy in creative expressions such as bullet journaling, calligraphy,
                    painting, and embroidery. Don't get me wrong, finding joy in it doesn't mean I'm a pro!
                    I'm also an avid badminton player, and am always up for a match of foosball.</p>
